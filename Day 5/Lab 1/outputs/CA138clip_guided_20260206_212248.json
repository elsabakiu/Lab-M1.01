Oh yes, I'll be so glad when they land back now, but I think that's a pretty well fact because they've landed so many safely now that I feel relieved. Just getting off of the Moon was the thing that was... Have they met with the one that was circling? Yes, they've rendezvoused, so I understand. That wasn't shown either, but they say they have rendezvoused, so that's a matter of making the circles and then coming down. What do you sort of imagine for the future? Do you imagine them sending up ships? I think they will. I think they will do some more exploring up there. Because that was such a very small area, when you think of it, that they just gathered rocks and samples of soil and all, and they did a probe for some samples, and just what was going to come of that. I don't know, I'd be glad to read it.",
