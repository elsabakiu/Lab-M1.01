1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
It was rather interesting just to watch them gathering

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,280
their materials and bouncing around their, what they call it,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,520
kangaroo walk or something like that.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,480
Who named it that?

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,480
I don't know.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,000
I bet those men are going to get quite a reception when

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,960
they get back to Maine.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,460
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,520
I'll be so glad when they land back now.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,680
But I think that's pretty well a fact,

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,320
because they've landed so many safely now.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but I feel relieved. Just getting off of the moon was the thing that was...

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Have they met with the one that was circling?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, they've rendezvoused. So I understand. That wasn't shown either, so I...

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But they say they have rendezvoused, so that's a matter of making the circles and then coming down.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What do you sort of imagine for the future? Do you imagine them sending a ship?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think they will. I think they will.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
And we'll do some more exploring up there.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,700
Very positive, they left us a hand with that.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,580
Because that was such a very small area,

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:16,180
when you think of it, that they just gathered rocks and, oh,

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,460
samples of soil and all.

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,380
And they did a probe for some samples.

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,820
And just what was going to come of that, I don't know.

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,260
I'd be glad to read it.
